# Hotel Configuration Dashboard
A group of stakeholders voiced the need for hotel settings to be in a single view to make it easier their configuration. They asked for a datadump file with all the data but I created an excel dashboard instead. This python query pulls all the data and writes it to a new file using an existing template. This is then emailed to the stakeholders.

The data lands in the same location each time and I used various filter formulas and VBA macros to configure the dashboard when it's opened.
